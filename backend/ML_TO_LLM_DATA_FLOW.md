## **ðŸŽ¯ How the LLM Uses This Data:**

### **Enhanced Prompt Structure:**
```python
ADVANCED ML INSIGHTS:
- Financial Health Score: 75/100 (Above 65% of peers)
- Churn Risk: 11.9% (Low risk)
- Anomaly Score: 49.7% (Normal Activity)
- Current Fund: Default Fund
- Recommended Funds: Fund A, Fund B, Fund C
- Monte Carlo Simulations: 10000 scenarios
- Probability of Meeting Target: 85.2%

```

### **Smart Table Generation:**
The LLM automatically creates relevant tables based on the question:

**Financial Health Questions:**
```
| Health Metric | Score | Status | Peer Percentile |
|---------------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Financial Health | 75/100 | Above peers | 65% |
| Churn Risk | 11.9% | Low | - |
| Anomaly Score | 49.7% | Normal | - |
```

**Fund Recommendation Questions:**
```
| Fund Type | Current | Recommended | Reason |
|-----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Current Fund | Default Fund | - | Your current choice |
| Top Recommendation | - | Fund A | Based on similar users |
| Alternative 1 | - | Fund B | Diversification |
| Alternative 2 | - | Fund C | Risk optimization |
```

**Monte Carlo Questions:**
```
| Scenario | Retirement Balance | Probability |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Conservative (10th percentile) | $500,000 | 10% |
| Moderate (50th percentile) | $650,000 | 50% |
| Optimistic (90th percentile) | $800,000 | 90% |
| Target Achievement | - | 85.2% |

**User Question:** *"What's my financial health score?"*

**LLM Response:** 
```
Summary
Your financial health score of 75/100 indicates strong financial wellness, placing you above 65% of your peer group. This is excellent progress toward your retirement goals.

Financial Health Analysis

- Your current score of 75/100 reflects good savings habits and contribution consistency
- You're performing above average compared to similar users in your age and income bracket
- Your low churn risk of 11.9% suggests you're likely to maintain your current contribution pattern

Areas for Improvement

- Consider increasing your contribution rate to reach the optimal 12% of income
- Review your fund selection - our model recommends Fund A, Fund B, or Fund C for better diversification
- Your Monte Carlo simulation shows an 85.2% probability of meeting your retirement target

Recommendations

1. Increase monthly contributions by $200 to reach optimal savings rate
2. Consider switching to Fund A for better risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio: 1.25)
3. Review your portfolio allocation quarterly to maintain optimal diversification

Encouragement Statement

You're on an excellent path to retirement! Your above-average financial health and low churn risk position you well for long-term success. Keep up the great work!
